# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Global Information Tracker, it's a system that allows you and other people to work on code together and maintain version control so that you don't have a crazy mess of a tracking system. The true value of git is realized the larger an organization gets.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The AND &&, OR ||, NOT !, greater than >, less than <, greater than or equal to >=, less than or equal to <=, loosely equal to ==, and strictly equal to === operators are logical operators which give you a result of true or false.

Researched answer: A boolean is a datatype that has only two values, true or false. This is important to programming because as code becomes more complicated, the returns will always be one of 6 (or 7 if you count BigInt) primitive datatypes. Being able to set conditionals to the result of a boolean is an integral part of programming.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is basically the address of an element or item in an array or string, whereas a value is what is located at the address. I like using the physical address example of country, state, county, city, street address. Your street address will tell someone where you live and they value there is your house.

Researched answer: An index is also known as "position" of a specified value. Values get a lot more complicated if you don't think of them as plainly "Things". Values all play different roles depending on the type of value it is. They can be numbers, functions, variables, arrays, and etc.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: It's basically what turn you're at when you do a repetitive task. When you iterate through something, you keep repeating it as many times as necessary until some condition is met. Plainly speaking, a farm worker will move through his crops every day (iteration) until there are no more crops to pick that day (end condition).

Researched answer: Iterations are also known as loops, they allow you to do repetitive asks while allowing you to not reeat yourself. Iteration is very handy when you want to do something over and over again while only adjusting a few pieces of information. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is where two people work together as a driver and navigator, the driver shares his screen and follows the directions of the navigator, who is responsible for directing the driver, watching for errors, and researching topics. The driver and navigator switch positions regularly so that both are engaged, which both increases productivity and efficiency, as the pair work together to solve problems.

Researched answer: The concept of Pair Programming comes from Agile Software Development techniques.toFancierExplanationOfSimpleConcept()
